      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">What is Kafka Software?</h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Kafka software</strong>, also known as Apache Kafka, is an open-source platform designed for handling real-time data streams. Developers around the world use Kafka for building scalable, fault-tolerant applications that require fast, asynchronous data processing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How Kafka Works</h2>
      <p>
        Kafka uses a publish-subscribe model. It collects data from producers (apps, sensors, APIs) and allows multiple consumers to read that data simultaneously — enabling microservices, data analytics, and IoT systems.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Use Kafka?</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Scalable: Easily handles millions of messages per second</li>
        <li>Durable: Stores data reliably across clusters</li>
        <li>Flexible: Supports real-time and batch processing</li>
        <li>Widely adopted: Used by LinkedIn, Netflix, Flipkart, Zomato, and many more</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Kafka Use Cases in India and Worldwide</h2>
      <p>
        In India, Kafka is increasingly popular among fintech startups, logistics platforms, and e-commerce apps. Internationally, it's a key component in high-traffic architectures where performance and scale matter.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How Developers Use Kafka</h2>
      <p>
        Kafka is often used with backend stacks like Spring Boot, Node.js, and Python. It integrates with data lakes, message brokers, and analytics pipelines, making it essential for modern cloud-native architectures.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're building an app in Bangalore or Boston, <strong>Kafka software</strong> gives you the tools to stream, process, and scale data in real-time. It’s the go-to solution for teams building future-ready apps.
