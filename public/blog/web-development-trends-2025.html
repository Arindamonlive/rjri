      <h1>Top Web Development Trends in 2025</h1>

      <p>
        The <strong>web development</strong> landscape in 2025 is more dynamic than ever — driven by global digital transformation, AI-powered tools, and rising expectations from users worldwide, including in India’s rapidly expanding internet economy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. AI & Machine Learning in Front-End</h2>
      <p>
        AI is now embedded into UI/UX — powering personalization, accessibility, and design automation. Builders globally are using AI for smart suggestions and real-time content adaptations.
      </p>

      <h2>2. JAMstack & Headless CMS</h2>
      <p>
        Developers are shifting from traditional CMS to headless architectures using tools like Strapi, Sanity, and Contentful. JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) delivers lightning-fast, SEO-friendly websites that scale.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Web Performance is the New SEO</h2>
      <p>
        Google Core Web Vitals are a must for ranking. Indian companies and global brands alike now prioritize loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability to retain users.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Design Systems and Component Libraries</h2>
      <p>
        Frameworks like Tailwind, Material UI, and Chakra UI are becoming the norm for scalable, accessible UI development. Design consistency across markets is now a core strategy.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Regional UX for Global Reach</h2>
      <p>
        Web teams in India and beyond are designing with multilingual, low-bandwidth, and mobile-first experiences in mind — to reach both rural and international users seamlessly.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a startup founder in Bengaluru or Berlin, these <strong>web development trends</strong> in 2025 will shape how your users experience the digital world. Stay adaptive, think globally, and build with users in mind.
